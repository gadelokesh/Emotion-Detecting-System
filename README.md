# Binary_Emotion_Detector_App üé≠

## Emotion Detector App  
A Deep Learning-Based Image Classification App to Detect Happiness or Sadness  

---

## üöÄ About the Project  
The **Emotion Detector App** is a powerful image classification tool that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect emotions (Happy or Sad) in images. The backend model is trained with **TensorFlow/Keras**, and the frontend is implemented using **Streamlit** for an intuitive user experience.

## üéØ Key Features  

### Deep Learning Model:
- Trained using a **CNN architecture** with multiple layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense).  
- Achieves binary classification (Happy or Sad) with high accuracy.  

### Streamlit Frontend:
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying predictions.  

### Efficient Workflow:
- **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized and resized for model compatibility.  
- **Model Training**: Trained on labeled datasets over 50 epochs using RMSprop optimizer and binary crossentropy loss.  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Users can upload images to get instant emotion detection results.
